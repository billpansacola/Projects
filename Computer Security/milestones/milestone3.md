# **Milestone 3**

1) As a group we switched from C++ to Python because of the time limit we have. Ben wrote the transaction class and implemented its verification. Dane wrote the http networking between server and clients using the request, flask, and pickle libraries. Connor was converting his C++ blockchain code to Python and adding more fuctionality. Bill was working on proof of work.

2) This week Dane will work on cleaning up the netwrking code and adding locks to the server file and adding a couple more functions. Ben enable user to publish transactions and intergation. 

3) Waiting on Connor and Bill to update us on the progess they made on their parts of the project so we can move forward with the intergration step
